Make sure the right pins are added into every test. 
to set the whole screen to specific color use .clear instead of the demo code. 
for the fonts, remove the file name and ensure that the file is formated correctly, pico uploads just the file directories and not the folder so if you get error that means you added the folder and not the font from the file directly. 
the only way to display text is to use pre masde fonts.
